;;this library generates the church-specific header definitions.
;;the header includes:
;;  church-make-xrp
;;  church-apply, church-eval
;;  mcmc helper code.
;;  deterministic (non-higher-order) scheme primitives wrapped up into church- forms. 

;;this should generate scheme compatible with r4rs+srfi1.

;;NOTE: primitive symbols not otherwise defined are assumed to be provided by the target language. this includes, for example, a bunch of random sampling/scoring functions that xrp-preamble will want.
